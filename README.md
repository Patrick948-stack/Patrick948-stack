👋 Hi, I'm Patrick Mulikuza

I'm a Computer Science sophomore at Whitman College exploring how code, data, and design can work together to solve real problems.
I enjoy building interactive visualizations, experimenting with AI, and bringing ideas to life through full-stack projects.

🎓 Major: Computer Science (with Physics coursework)

💻 Interests: Software engineering, data visualization, and AI/ML

🌱 Currently learning: JavaScript, Haskell, Plotly.js, and building interactive 3D visualizations

🚀 Goal this year: Build polished projects and grow as a developer through experience

🔧 Technologies & Tools

Languages: Python, C++, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Haskell (beginner)
Libraries & Tools: Matplotlib, Plotly.js, Turtle, Git/GitHub, VS Code
Concepts: Data visualisation, 3D plotting, OOP, basic algorithms & data structures
Learning in progress: Full-stack web apps, frontend design, browser-based interactivity

🧩 Projects
📊 GPA Visualizer & Certificate Generator (Python)

A two-part interactive Python program that helps students understand their semester performance.
It prompts the user for all courses, credits, and grades, then generates Matplotlib pie and bar charts showing each course’s contribution to the overall GPA.
The project also creates a personalized, decorative GPA certificate using Python’s Turtle graphics, blending visualization with fun graphical output.

🗻 3D Elevation Plot – Mount Kilimanjaro (JavaScript, Plotly.js)

A browser-based 3D surface visualization using real elevation data.
Loads and parses CSV datasets in JavaScript, then renders a fully interactive 3D model of Mount Kilimanjaro with Plotly.js.
Shows experience in JavaScript, data preparation, and geospatial visualization.

⛰️ 3D Elevation Plot – Mount Everest (JavaScript, Plotly.js)

A companion visualization to the Kilimanjaro project.
Plots a high-resolution Mount Everest elevation dataset as a 3D terrain map, demonstrating JavaScript data handling, surface rendering, and scientific visualization.

🤖 Whitman AI Chatbot – Frontend Interface + Training Data (HTML, CSS, JS)

Built the full frontend chat interface for Whitman AI, a campus-focused chatbot.
Created a responsive UI with message bubbles, typing indicators, and DOM-based rendering.
Also helped collect and organise training data for the underlying machine learning model.

🎼 Walla Walla Symphony Web App (In Progress) – Tickets & Merch Platform

Currently developing the front end of a new web application for the Walla Walla Symphony.
The project aims to support the sale of tickets and merchandise online, giving the symphony a modern, accessible digital platform.
Exploring responsive layouts, clean UI/UX, and integrating real functional components.
